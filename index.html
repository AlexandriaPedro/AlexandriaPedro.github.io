    <h3>nothing to se here... Only me, myself and I.</h3>
    <p>So, I just a math student who likes a lot of computation, I draw and write a few things from time to time, and here is a """well""" selected collection of a few things I'd love to share with the world.</p>
    <p>The pseudonym "Blunk Dude" is the artistic being that I use/used to publish the arts on the networks, and being none other than myself, his name represents the two colors I love the most: blue and pink! Then you add those two words together and boom: Blunk Dude!</p>
    <p>Anyway, I hope you enjoy something here,</p>
    <p>Stay safe, OK?</p>
    </p>Pedro H. P. de Alexandria</p>
